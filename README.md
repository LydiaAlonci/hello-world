# hello-world
A good beginning makes a good end.

Hi all,
I'm Lydia. I am a mom of two young kids, a current student at SNHU (graduating this spring), future IT project manager, with aspirations to become a CIO. My hobby is learning, and my bucket list is mostly made up of places to travel and things I'd like to know. Coding has literally changed my life, so I am so glad to be here!
